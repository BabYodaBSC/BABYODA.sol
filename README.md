BABYODA was inspired by the idea of joining the forces of cuteness overload
and the legacy of Master Yoda in one, ultimate meme token. 
For the first minutes of launch, only 500 billions $BabYoda per transaction will be allowed.
It will be increased to 1 Trillion and go on like that for the rest of the time. In order to keep the tokens homogenously distributed among the holders, a wallet will only be able to hold 10 Trillions of $BABYODA.
